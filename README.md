This project, Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography, allows you to hide secret messages inside an image and later retrieve them using a passcode. It works by modifying the image pixels in a way that is not noticeable to the human eye.

🔹 How it Works?
You enter a secret message and choose an image.
The program hides your message inside the image.
Later, you can decrypt the message using the correct passcode.

🔹 Why is this Useful?
Helps in secure communication without anyone knowing.
Hidden data is invisible in the image.
Easy to use and works with PNG images.


🔹 Technologies Used:
Python 🐍
OpenCV (for image processing) 🖼
NumPy (for handling pixel data)
This project is perfect for anyone curious about cybersecurity and steganography! 🚀
